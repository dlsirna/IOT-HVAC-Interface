 Online thermostat controller
 
  This project came from a need for a thermostat capable of complex scheduling, to save money my roomates and I prefer to keep the heat off, however it proved impossible to get out of bed and enter the frigid wasteland that was our house, so i set out to build something to fix our problem.
  I knew it was relatively possible because the nest thermostat exists, and my next thought was "can I do that?", after an amazing learning experience later (HVAC I/O and relays, soldering, learning about NTP, learning about juggling I/O and listeners on a single-core mircro controller(esp 8266)) this what I have come up with.

 The application interface is currently protyped using Blynk https://blynk.io/) 
 the blynk library allows for easy use of virtual pins withint he blynk library, as well as a scheduling interface, an RTC module.
 This all culminates to a thermostat scheduler

 //TODO
Houskeeping: (1)refactor the c++ code(very hard to read)  (2)migrate from prototyping platform to a custom android app to learn more about building apps and TCP/IP, networking, interfacing with microcontrollers.
Future features: a money saving feature that turns the heat/ac low when known mobile devices have left the network(no one is home).
